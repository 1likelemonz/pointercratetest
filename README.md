# Pointercrate

As of march 2nd 2019 this is the official repository for pointercrate. It contains all the backend (Rust) and frontend (JavaScript/CSS and html templating in form of rust macros) code that runs pointercrate.

## Special thanks

The following people have helped with development of pointercrate, either through code contributions or other things:

- cos8o: Reverse engineered parts of the Geometry Dash source that allows pointercrate to display accurate object counts and level lengths
- GunnerBones and PoisoN: Development of various discord bots integrating with the pointercrate API
- Aquatias and Deltablu: My trusty admins that click checkboxes for me (love you guys)
- and of course the developers of all the dependencies pointercrate uses
